rundeck-android
===============

Currently this is only a proof of concept.

This is a client for rundeck (http://rundeck.org/), running on android.
Currently it is tested in the Andoird emulator and only connecting to my localy running rundeck server.#
It lists my projects, the jobs for each project and I can start a job.

I'm using these libraries to make this work:
